<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul> 
    <li>1 cup soy sauce </li>
    <li> 1 cup granulated sugar </li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoons brown sugar  </li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed in a press  </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger  </li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
    <li>1 3-inch cinnamon stick  </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon pineapple juice</li>
    <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs  </li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons cornstarch </li>
</ul>

<h2> Directions </h2>

<ol>
<li> In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch and chicken. <br> 
    Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and stir until sugar is dissolved, <br> 
     about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard cinnamon stick and mix in 1/2 cup water.</li>
<li> Place chicken in a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add soy sauce mixture, seal bag, and <br> 
    turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate for at least an hour, ideally overnight.</li>
<li>Remove chicken and set aside. Pour mixture into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over <br> 
    high heat, then reduce heat to low. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to pan. <br>
     Stir until mixture begins to thicken, and gradually stir in enough water (about 1/2 cup) until <br>
      sauce is the consistency of heavy cream. Remove from heat and set aside. </li>
<li>Preheat a broiler or grill. Lightly brush chicken pieces on all sides with sauce, and broil or grill <br> 
     about 3 minutes per side. While chicken is cooking, place sauce over high heat and bring to a boil, <br>
      then reduce heat to a bare simmer, adding water a bit at a time to keep mixture at a pourable consistency. <br>
       To serve, slice chicken into strips, arrange on plates, and drizzle with sauce. </li>

</ol>
