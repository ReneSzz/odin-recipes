    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil </li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp freshly grated ginger </li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded carrots </li>
        <li>1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced (optional) </li>
        <li>4 cups Chicken or vegetable broth </li>
        <li>1 TBSP rice vinegar </li>
        <li> 3 TBSP low-sodium soy sauce (more to taste)</li>
        <li> 1 TBSP Sriracha sauce (more or less, depending on your heat tolerance) </li>
        <li> 2 3 oz portions of Ramen (discard the flavor packets)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a medium-large saucepan over moderate heat <br> 
            (see notes). Add garlic and ginger, and simmer until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. <br>
             Do not brown the garlic, or else you'll get a bitter flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and mushrooms if you're using them, and simmer until they soften, about a minute, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, Sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir, and bring to a simmer; <br> 
            let it go for about five minutes. Taste, and adjust heat and taste to your liking by adding more Sriracha and soy sauce if needed.</li>
        <li>While the broth simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the package's instructions. <br> 
            (You could cook the noodles in the broth directly, but that makes for a messy transfer to a bowl. <br>
             It's much easier to transfer drained cooked noodles to a bowl and spoon the broth over top.) <br> 
             Once the noodles are tender, drain and rinse under cool water, place into a soup bowl, and set aside.</li>
        <li>When the soup is ready, spoon the broth over the noodles. Allow to cool. At this point, make your <br>
             soft-boiled egg if you're garnishing with one, and add the rest of your toppings to serve.</li>
